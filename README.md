- 👋 Hi, I’m Abhinav sahani.
- 👀 My major interested is in Data.
- 🌱 I believe learning is a continous process.
- 💞️ If your requirements involve data, I CAN HELP. Here's how-

        1) If you don't have data, I'll scrap some for you from websites, social media using beautifulsoup, selenium, API, etc.
        2) If you have data and want someone to explore it, I'll analyze it by EDA and create a story out of it.
        3) If you want to understand your data and make decisions, I'll find patterns and insight from data by visualization.
        4) If you want to create a statistical machine learning model on your data, I'll build the best model by using Machine Learning Algorithm.

   I use python, jupyter notebook, google colab, Rstudio, PoweBI, Tableau to perform the above tasks.
